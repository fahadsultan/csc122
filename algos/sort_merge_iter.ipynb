    "Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) in 1945. Merge sort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a \"less-than\" relation (formally, a total order) is defined.\n",
    "\n",

    "It is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Divide**: Convert the input unsorted n-element list into a list of n sublists each of length 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conquer**: Repeatedly, 'merge' adjacent pairs of sublists until there is only one sorted list remaining. \n",

    "\n",
    "The merge sort algorithm starts with $n$ sublists of size 1 and ends with a 1 sorted list of size $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In going from $n$ sublists to 1 sublist, it repeatedly merges two sorted lists into one sorted list. That means, at each step the number of sorted lists is halved! \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the number of steps required to reach a single sorted list is $\\log_2 n$ or $\\log n$, if we ignore the base. \n",
    "\n",
    "The merge procedure scales linearly with the size of the input lists. Therefore, the time complexity of merge sort is $O(n\\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pass requires $O(n)$ comparisons for merging, so the overall complexity is $O(n\\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of merge sort is $O(n)$. The `merge` function requires an auxiliary array of size $n$. "
