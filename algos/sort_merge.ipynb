    "Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. Merge sort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a \"less-than\" relation (formally, a total order) is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.\n",
