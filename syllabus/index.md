## Course Description

A second course in Computer Programming emphasizing Object-Oriented design, Linear Data Structures, and Algorithm design and analysis. Topics include: Objects, Classes, Inheritance, Linked lists, Queues, Stacks, Recursion, Searching, and Sorting. 

## Course Goals and Outcomes

Building on computational thinking and problem-solving skills from CSC-121. 

1. **Algorithm Development**
    * Understand algorithm development as an iterative process
    * Communicate an algorithm as a language independent sequence of steps.
    * Interpret and implement recursive algorithms.

2. **Algorithm Application and Analysis**
    * Choosing the right algorithm given the problem parameters (inputs and outputs)
        * Pattern recognition / transfer: When confronted with a problem being able to recall a similar problem previously seen and its solution.
    * Evaluating efficiency of algorithms.

3. Implementation and understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming** such as **inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation**.

4. Students will develop basic skills in modeling and implementing object-oriented solutions, including **Linear Data Structures**: 
    * Linked lists
    * Stacks
    * Queues

5. **Code Literacy**
    * Code tracing (with appropriate visualization) 
        * State the output of a given block of code.
    * Describe what a code block does at a high-level rather than what it says (reversal of design implementation)

6. **Testing as Iterative Verification**: Code writing and bug fixing, test conception and writing. Ability to identify for an algorithm: average cases, boundary cases, negative cases, extreme cases. Treat code as guilty until proven innocent.
