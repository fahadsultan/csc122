    "## Object-oriented features\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it provides features that support **object-oriented programming**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not easy to define object-oriented programming, but we have already seen some of its characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Programs are made up of object definitions and function definitions, and most of the computation is expressed in terms of operations on objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Each object definition corresponds to some object or concept in the real world, and the functions that operate on that object correspond to the ways real-world objects interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the Time class defined in the Classes and functions chapter corresponds to the way people record the time of day, and the functions we defined correspond to the kinds of things people do with times. Similarly, the `Point` and Rectangle classes correspond to the mathematical concepts of a point and a rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have not taken advantage of the features Python provides to support object-oriented programming. Strictly speaking, these features are not necessary. For the most part, they provide an alternative syntax for things we have already done, but in many cases, the alternative is more concise and more accurately conveys the structure of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the Time program, there is no obvious connection between the class definition and the function definitions that follow. With some examination, it is apparent that every function takes at least one Time object as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This observation is the motivation for **methods**. We have already seen some methods, such as `keys` and `values`, which were invoked on dictionaries. Each method is associated with a class and is intended to be invoked on instances of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are just like functions, with two differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Methods are defined inside a class definition in order to make the relationship between the class and the method explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The syntax for invoking a method is different from the syntax for calling a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few sections, we will take the functions from previous chapters and transform them into methods. This transformation is purely mechanical; you can do it simply by following a sequence of steps. If you are comfortable converting from one form to another, you will be able to choose the best form for whatever you are doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `print_time`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Classes and functions chapter, we defined a class named Time and you wrote a function named print_time, which should have looked something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Time(object):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_time(time):\n",
    "    print(str(time.hours) + \":\" +\n",
    "          str(time.minutes) + \":\" +\n",
    "          str(time.seconds))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To call this function, we passed a Time object as a parameter:"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "code",
   "execution_count": null,
   "metadata": {},
   "outputs": [],
   "source": [
    "current_time = Time()\n",
    "current_time.hours = 9\n",
    "current_time.minutes = 14\n",
    "current_time.seconds = 30\n",
    "print_time(current_time)"
   ]
  },
  {
   "attachments": {},
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "To make print_time a method, all we have to do is move the function definition inside the class definition. Notice the change in indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Time(object):\n",
    "    def print_time(time):\n",
    "        print(str(time.hours) + \":\" +\n",
    "              str(time.minutes) + \":\" +\n",
    "              str(time.seconds))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can invoke `print_time` using dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "current_time.print_time()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, the object on which the method is invoked appears before the dot and the name of the method appears after the dot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object on which the method is invoked is assigned to the first parameter, so in this case `current_time` is assigned to the parameter `time`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, the first parameter of a method is called self. The reason for this is a little convoluted, but it is based on a useful metaphor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for a function call, `print_time(current_time)`, suggests that the function is the active agent. It says something like, Hey `print_time`! Here’s an object for you to print.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, the objects are the active agents. An invocation like `current_time.print_time()` says Hey current_time! Please print yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "This change in perspective might be more polite, but it is not obvious that it is useful. In the examples we have seen so far, it may not be. But sometimes shifting responsibility from the functions onto the objects makes it possible to write more versatile functions, and makes it easier to maintain and reuse code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Another example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s convert `increment` to a method. To save space, we will leave out previously defined methods, but you should keep them in your version:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Time(object):\n",
    "    #previous method definitions here...\n",
    "\n",
    "    def increment(self, seconds):\n",
    "        self.seconds = seconds + self.seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "        while self.seconds >= 60:\n",
    "            self.seconds = self.seconds - 60\n",
    "            self.minutes = self.minutes + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "        while self.minutes >= 60:\n",
    "            self.minutes = self.minutes - 60\n",
    "            self.hours = self.hours + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation is purely mechanical - we move the method definition into the class definition and change the name of the first parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can invoke `increment` as a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "current_time.increment(500)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the object on which the method is invoked gets assigned to the first parameter, `self`. The second parameter, `seconds` gets the value 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A more complicated example\n",
    "\n",
    "The `after` function is slightly more complicated because it operates on two `Time` objects, not just one. We can only convert one of the parameters to `self`; the other stays the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Time(object):\n",
    "    #previous method definitions here...\n",
    "\n",
    "    def after(self, time2):\n",
    "        if self.hour > time2.hour:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "        if self.hour < time2.hour:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "\n",
    "        if self.minute > time2.minute:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "        if self.minute < time2.minute:\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "\n",
    "        if self.second > time2.second:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We invoke this method on one object and pass the other as an argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if doneTime.after(current_time):\n",
    "    print(\"The bread will be done after it starts.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can almost read the invocation like English: If the done-time is after the current-time, then…\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optional arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen built-in functions that take a variable number of arguments. For example, `string.find` can take two, three, or four arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to write user-defined functions with optional argument lists. For example, we can upgrade our own version of `find` to do the same thing as `string.find`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the original version:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find(str, ch):\n",
    "    index = 0\n",
    "    while index < len(str):\n",
    "        if str[index] == ch:\n",
    "            return index\n",
    "        index = index + 1\n",
    "    return -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the new and improved version:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def find(str, ch, start=0):\n",
    "    index = start\n",
    "    while index < len(str):\n",
    "        if str[index] == ch:\n",
    "            return index\n",
    "        index = index + 1\n",
    "    return -1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The third parameter, `start`, is optional because a default value, 0, is provided. If we invoke find with only two arguments, we use the default value and start from the beginning of the string:"

The default value of `end` should be `len(str)`, but that doesn’t work. The default values are evaluated when the function is defined, not when it is called. When `find` is defined, `str` doesn’t exist yet, so you can’t find its length."
