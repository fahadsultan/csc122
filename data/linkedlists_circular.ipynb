    "# Circular Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular linked lists are a type of linked list where the last node points back to the first node. This makes it a circular data structure. In this notebook, we will implement a circular linked list and its operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two types of circular linked lists:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Singly Circular Linked List**: In this type of circular linked list, each node has a single pointer that points to the next node in the list.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Doubly Circular Linked List**: In this type of circular linked list, each node has two pointers: one that points to the next node and one that points to the previous node in the list.\n",

    "## Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by implementing the `Node` class for the singly circular linked list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Node:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, data):\n",
    "        self.data = data\n",
    "        self.next = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that this is unchanged from the singly linked list implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CircularLinkedList\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will implement the circular linked list class. It has a head field that points to the first node in the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CircularLinkedList:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.head = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert a new node in a circular linked list, we need to follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new node with the given data.\n",
    "2. If the list is empty, set the head to the new node and make the new node point to itself.\n",
    "3. Otherwise, traverse the list to find the last node.\n",
    "4. Make the last node point to the new node.\n",
    "5. Make the new node point to the head node.\n",
    "\n",

    "        # step 1. create a new node\n",
    "        new_node = Node(data) \n",
    "\n",
    "        # step 2. if the list is empty, set the head to the new node\n",
    "        if self.is_empty():\n",

    "To delete a node from a circular linked list, we need to follow these steps:\n",

    "3. If the node is not found, return.\n",
    "4. If the node to be deleted is the head node:\n",
    "    - If the list has only one node, set the head to None.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, find the last node and make it point to the next node of the head.\n",
    "5. If the node to be deleted is not the head node:\n",
    "    - If the node to be deleted is the last node, make the previous node point to the head.\n",
