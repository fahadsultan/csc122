Instead, a new value is created and assigned to the variable. Once the new value has been assigned to the variable, the old value is no longer needed and is removed from memory.\n",

For example, it means that we can safely pass these data types to functions without worrying that the function will modify the value of the variable that was passed to it. This is because immutable data types are passed to functions by value, not by reference.\n",
