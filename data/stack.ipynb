    "## Abstract data types\n",
    "\n",
    "The data types you have seen so far are all concrete, in the sense that we have completely specified how they are implemented. For example, the `Card` class represents a card using two integers. As we discussed at the time, that is not the only way to represent a card; there are many alternative implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **abstract data type**, or ADT, specifies a set of operations (or methods) and the semantics of the operations (what they do), but it does not not specify the implementation of the operations. That’s what makes it abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is that useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It simplifies the task of specifying an algorithm if you can denote the operations you need without having to think at the same time about how the operations are performed.\n",
    "2. Since there are usually many ways to implement an ADT, it might be useful to write an algorithm that can be used with any of the possible implementations.\n",
    "3. Well-known ADTs, such as the Stack ADT in this chapter, are often implemented in standard libraries so they can be written once and used by many programmers.\n",
    "4. The operations on ADTs provide a common high-level language for specifying and talking about algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about ADTs, we often distinguish the code that uses the ADT, called the **client** code, from the code that implements the ADT, called the **provider** code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Stack ADT\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will look at one common ADT, the **stack**. A stack is a collection, meaning that it is a data structure that contains multiple elements. Other collections we have seen include dictionaries and lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ADT is defined by the operations that can be performed on it, which is called an **interface**. The interface for a stack consists of these operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__init__`: Initialize a new empty stack.\n",
    "* `push`: Add a new item to the stack.\n",
    "* `pop`: Remove and return an item from the stack. The item that is returned is always the last one that was added.\n",
    "* `is_empty`: Check whether the stack is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stack is sometimes called a last in, first out or LIFO data structure, because the last item added is the first to be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing stacks with Python lists\n",
    "\n",
    "The list operations that Python provides are similar to the operations that define a stack. The interface isn’t exactly what it is supposed to be, but we can write code to translate from the Stack ADT to the built-in operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is called an **implementation** of the Stack ADT. In general, an implementation is a set of methods that satisfy the syntactic and semantic requirements of an interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an implementation of the Stack ADT that uses a Python list:"

    "\n",
    "You should compare this bit of code to the implementation of `print_backward` in the Linked lists chapter. There is a natural parallel between the recursive version of `print_backward` and the stack algorithm here. The difference is that print_backward uses the runtime stack to keep track of the nodes while it traverses the list, and then prints them on the way back from the recursion. The stack algorithm does the same thing, except that is use a `Stack` object instead of the runtime stack.\n",

    "## Using a stack to evaluate postfix\n",
    "\n",
    "In most programming languages, mathematical expressions are written with the operator between the two operands, as in `1 + 2`. This format is called **infix**. An alternative used by some calculators is called **postfix**. In postfix, the operator follows the operands, as in `1 2 +`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason postfix is sometimes useful is that there is a natural way to evaluate a postfix expression using a stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Starting at the beginning of the expression, get one term (operator or operand) at a time.\n",
    "    * If the term is an operand, push it on the stack.\n",
    "    * If the term is an operator, pop two operands off the stack, perform the operation on them, and push the result back on the stack.\n",
    "2. When you get to the end of the expression, there should be exactly one operand left on the stack. That operand is the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parsing \n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the previous algorithm, we need to be able to traverse a string and break it into operands and operators. This process is an example of **parsing**, and the results—the individual chunks of the string – are called **tokens**. You might remember these words from the The way of the program chapter.\n",
    "\n",

For example, `[A-z]` is the set of all letters and `[0-9]` is the set of all numbers. The ^ operator negates a set, so `[^0-9]` is the set of everything that is not a number, which is exactly the set we want to use to split up postfix expressions:"
