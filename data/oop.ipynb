    "Recall from the [Introduction](https://fahadsultan.com/csc122/intro.html#strike-data-structures-algrorithms-strike-br-complexity-abstraction-and-scalability) that an average piece of software is measured in millions of lines of code. \n",

    "This code is written by many different people, and it is constantly changing. This is a complex and chaotic situation, and the only way to manage it is to impose structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to organize and structure code in a way that makes that makes large codebases more manageable and scalable.\n",

    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary abstractions in computer programming that you have already been using:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data abstractions**: A way to refer to, store and manipulate data without having to understand the details of how it is implemented e.g. variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Procedural abstractions**: A way to refer to, store and manipulate procedures (functions) without having to understand the details of how they are implemented e.g. functions. \n",

    "\n",
    "The atomic indivisible unit of data in computer programming is called a **value**. Values are the most basic things that a computer program manipulates or calculates. For example, the number `42` is a value. So is `\"Hello World!\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each value belongs to a **type**. The type of a value determines its interpretation by the computer and the operations that can be performed on it.    For example, the value `42` is of type `int` (short for integer) and the value `\"Hello World!\"` is of type `str` (short for string, so-called because it contains a _string_ of letters).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate **variables**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to algebra, variables in computer programming are **names that refer to values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In algebra, the following statement declares that the variable `x` has the value `42`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = 42$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the following statement declares that the variable `x` has the value `42`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a just a name. Values are somewhere else, and a variable refers to a value. Multiple names can refer to the same value. Python calls whatever is needed to refer to a value a reference. Assigning to a variable simply makes it refer to another value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are the first means of abstraction in computer programming. They allow us to abstract away the details of the value and refer to computations in more general terms.\n",
