    "# Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it provides features that support [object-oriented programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) ( OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming has its roots in the 1960s, but it wasnâ€™t until the mid 1980s that it became the main [programming paradigm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) used in the creation of new software. It was developed as a way to handle the rapidly increasing size and complexity of software systems, and to make it easier to modify these large and complex systems over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now we have been writing programs using a [procedural programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) paradigm. In procedural programming the focus is on writing functions or procedures which operate on data. In object-oriented programming the focus is on the creation of objects which contain both data and functionality together."
