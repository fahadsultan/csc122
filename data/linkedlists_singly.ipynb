    "Singly linked lists are a type of data structure that is made up of nodes that are created using self-referential structures. Each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. The first node is called the **head** and the last node is called the **tail**. The tail node points to a null reference. Singly linked lists are used to implement other data structures such as stacks, queues, and graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Singly linked lists are useful because they allow for constant time insertion and deletion of elements at the beginning of the list. However, they do not allow for constant time access to elements in the middle of the list. To access an element in the middle of the list, you must traverse the list from the head node to the desired node.\n",
