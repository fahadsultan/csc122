    "Some lists are well formed ; others are not. For example, if a list contains a loop, it will cause many of our methods to crash, so we might want to require that lists contain no loops. Another requirement is that the `length` value in the `LinkedList` object should be equal to the actual number of nodes in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements like these are called **invariants** because, ideally, they should be true of every object all the time. Specifying invariants for objects is a useful programming practice because it makes it easier to prove the correctness of code, check the integrity of data structures, and detect errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that is sometimes confusing about invariants is that there are times when they are violated. For example, in the middle of `addFirst`, after we have added the node but before we have incremented `length`, the invariant is violated. This kind of violation is acceptable; in fact, it is often impossible to modify an object without violating an invariant for at least a little while. Normally, we require that every method that violates an invariant must restore the invariant.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is any significant stretch of code in which the invariant is violated, it is important for the comments to make that clear, so that no operations are performed that depend on the invariant.\n",
