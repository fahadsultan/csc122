    "# User-defined Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ## User-defined compound types -->\n",
    "\n",
    "A class in essence defines a new data type. We have been using several of Python’s built-in types throughout this book, we are now ready to create our own user-defined type: the `Point`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the concept of a mathematical point. In two dimensions, a point is two numbers (coordinates) that are treated collectively as a single object. In mathematical notation, points are often written in parentheses with a comma separating the coordinates. For example, `(0, 0)` represents the origin, and `(x, y)` represents the point x units to the right and y units up from the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural way to represent a point in Python is with two numeric values. The question, then, is how to group these two values into a compound object. The quick and dirty solution is to use a list or tuple, and for some applications that might be the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to define a new user-defined compound type, also called a class. This approach involves a bit more effort, but it has advantages that will be apparent soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class definition looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Represents a point in 2-D space.\"\"\"\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Class definitions can appear anywhere in a program, but they are usually near the beginning (after the `import` statements). The syntax rules for a class definition are the same as for other compound statements. There is a header which begins with the keyword, `class`, followed by the name of the class, and ending with a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition creates a new class called `Point`. The **pass** statement has no effect; it is only necessary because a compound statement must have something in its body. A docstring could serve the same purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "    \"Point class for storing mathematical points.\"\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating the Point class, we created a new type, also called `Point`. The members of this type are called **instances** of the type or **objects**. Creating a new instance is called instantiation, and is accomplished by calling the class. Classes, like functions, are callable, and we instantiate a Point object by calling the Point class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> type(Point)\n",
    "<type 'classobj'>\n",
    ">>> p = Point()\n",
    ">>> type(p)\n",
    "<type 'instance'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable p is assigned a reference to a new `Point` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be helpful to think of a class as a factory for making objects, so our `Point` class is a factory for making points. The class itself isn’t an instance of a point, but it contains the machinary to make point instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Like real world objects, object instances have both form and function. The form consists of data elements contained within the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add new data elements to an instance using dot notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> p.x = 3\n",
    ">>> p.y = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax is similar to the syntax for selecting a variable from a module, such as math.pi or string.uppercase. Both modules and instances create their own namespaces, and the syntax for accessing names contained in each, called **attributes**, is the same. In this case the attribute we are selecting is a data item from an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following state diagram shows the result of these assignments:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/courses/CS21Book/_images/point.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable p refers to a Point object, which contains two attributes. Each attribute refers to a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can read the value of an attribute using the same syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print(p.y)\n",
    "4\n",
    ">>> x = p.x\n",
    ">>> print(x)\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression p.x means, “Go to the object p refers to and get the value of x”. In this case, we assign that value to a variable named x. There is no conflict between the variable x and the attribute x. The purpose of dot notation is to identify which variable you are referring to unambiguously.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use dot notation as part of any expression, so the following statements are legal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('(%d, %d)' % (p.x, p.y))\n",
    "distance_squared = p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line outputs `(3, 4)`; the second line calculates the value 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The initialization method and `self`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our `Point` class is intended to represent two dimensional mathematical points, _all_ point instances ought to have `x` and `y` attributes, but that is not yet so with our Point objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> p2 = Point()\n",
    ">>> p2.x\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in ?\n",
    "AttributeError: Point instance has no attribute 'x'\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem we add an **initialization method** to our class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "        self.y = y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A **method** behaves like a function but it is part of an object. Like a data attribute it is accessed using dot notation. The initialization method is called automatically when the class is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s add another method, distance_from_origin, to see better how methods work:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "        self.y = y\n",
    "\n",
    "    def distance_from_origin(self):\n",
    "        return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s create a few point instances, look at their attributes, and call our new method on them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> p = Point(3, 4)\n",
    ">>> p.x\n",
    "3\n",
    ">>> p.y\n",
    "4\n",
    ">>> p.distance_from_origin()\n",
    "5.0\n",
    ">>> q = Point(5, 12)\n",
    ">>> q.x\n",
    "5\n",
    ">>> q.y\n",
    "12\n",
    ">>> q.distance_from_origin()\n",
    "13.0\n",
    ">>> r = Point()\n",
    ">>> r.x\n",
    "0\n",
    ">>> r.y\n",
    "0\n",
    ">>> r.distance_from_origin()\n",
    "0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining a method, the first parameter refers to the instance being created. It is customary to name this parameter **self**. In the example session above, the `self` parameter refers to the instances p, q, and r respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instances as parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass an instance as a parameter to a function in the usual way. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def print_point(p):\n",
    "    print('(%s, %s)' % (str(p.x), str(p.y)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`print_point` takes a point as an argument and displays it in the standard format. If you call `print_point(p)` with point `p` as defined previously, the output is `(3, 4)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<hr/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time \n",
    "\n",
    "As another example of a user-defined type, we’ll define a class called Time that records the time of day. The class definition looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Time(object):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a new Time object and assign attributes for hours, minutes, and seconds:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "time = Time()\n",
    "time.hours = 11\n",
    "time.minutes = 59\n",
    "time.seconds = 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The state diagram for the `Time` object looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/courses/CS21Book/_images/time.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pure functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few sections, we’ll write two versions of a function called add_time, which calculates the sum of two Times. They will demonstrate two kinds of functions: pure functions and modifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a rough version of `add_time`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_time(t1, t2):\n",
    "    sum = Time()\n",
    "    sum.hours = t1.hours + t2.hours\n",
    "    sum.minutes = t1.minutes + t2.minutes\n",
    "    sum.seconds = t1.seconds + t2.seconds\n",
    "    return sum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function creates a new `Time` object, initializes its attributes, and returns a reference to the new object. This is called a **pure function** because it does not modify any of the objects passed to it as parameters and it has no side effects, such as displaying a value or getting user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to use this function. We’ll create two Time objects: `current_time`, which contains the current time; and `bread_time`, which contains the amount of time it takes for a breadmaker to make bread. Then we’ll use `add_time` to figure out when the bread will be done. If you haven’t finished writing `print_time` yet, take a look ahead to Section before you try this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> current_time = Time()\n",
    ">>> current_time.hours = 9\n",
    ">>> current_time.minutes = 14\n",
    ">>> current_time.seconds =  30\n",
    ">>> bread_time = Time()\n",
    ">>> bread_time.hours = 3\n",
    ">>> bread_time.minutes = 35\n",
    ">>> bread_time.seconds = 0\n",
    ">>> done_time = add_time(current_time, bread_time)\n",
    ">>> print_time(done_time)\n",
    "12:49:30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this program is `12:49:30`, which is correct. On the other hand, there are cases where the result is not correct. Can you think of one?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that this function does not deal with cases where the number of seconds or minutes adds up to more than sixty. When that happens, we have to carry the extra seconds into the minutes column or the extra minutes into the hours column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a second corrected version of the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_time(t1, t2):\n",
    "    sum = Time()\n",
    "    sum.hours = t1.hours + t2.hours\n",
    "    sum.minutes = t1.minutes + t2.minutes\n",
    "    sum.seconds = t1.seconds + t2.seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "    if sum.seconds >= 60:\n",
    "        sum.seconds = sum.seconds - 60\n",
    "        sum.minutes = sum.minutes + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    if sum.minutes >= 60:\n",
    "        sum.minutes = sum.minutes - 60\n",
    "        sum.hours = sum.hours + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    return sum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this function is correct, it is starting to get big. Later we will suggest an alternative approach that yields shorter code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "There are times when it is useful for a function to modify one or more of the objects it gets as parameters. Usually, the caller keeps a reference to the objects it passes, so any changes the function makes are visible to the caller. Functions that work this way are called **modifiers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "`increment`, which adds a given number of seconds to a Time object, would be written most naturally as a modifier. A rough draft of the function looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def increment(time, seconds):\n",
    "    time.seconds = time.seconds + seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "    if time.seconds >= 60:\n",
    "        time.seconds = time.seconds - 60\n",
    "        time.minutes = time.minutes + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    if time.minutes >= 60:\n",
    "        time.minutes = time.minutes - 60\n",
    "        time.hours = time.hours + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line performs the basic operation; the remainder deals with the special cases we saw before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this function correct? What happens if the parameter `seconds` is much greater than sixty? In that case, it is not enough to carry once; we have to keep doing it until seconds is less than sixty. One solution is to replace the `if` statements with `while` statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def increment(time, seconds):\n",
    "    time.seconds = time.seconds + seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "    while time.seconds >= 60:\n",
    "        time.seconds = time.seconds - 60\n",
    "        time.minutes = time.minutes + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    while time.minutes >= 60:\n",
    "        time.minutes = time.minutes - 60\n",
    "        time.hours = time.hours + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "This function is now correct, but it is not very efficient. In Section we will see a faster alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Prototype development versus planning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we demonstrated an approach to program development that we call prototype development. In each case, we wrote a rough draft (or prototype) that performed the basic calculation and then tested it on a few cases, correcting flaws as we found them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this approach can be effective, it can lead to code that is unnecessarily complicated – since it deals with many special cases – and unreliable – since it is hard to know if you have found all the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is **planned development**, in which high-level insight into the problem can make the programming much easier. In this case, the insight is that a Time object is really a three-digit number in base 60! The `second` component is the ones column, the `minute` component is the sixties column, and the hour component is the thirty-six hundreds column.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we wrote add_time and increment, we were effectively doing addition in base 60, which is why we had to carry from one column to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "This observation suggests another approach to the whole problem – we can convert a Time object into a single number and take advantage of the fact that the computer knows how to do arithmetic with numbers. The following function converts a Time object into an integer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def convert_to_seconds(t):\n",
    "    minutes = t.hours * 60 + t.minutes\n",
    "    seconds = minutes * 60 + t.seconds\n",
    "    return seconds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, all we need is a way to convert from an integer to a `Time` object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def make_time(seconds):\n",
    "    time = Time()\n",
    "    time.hours = seconds/3600\n",
    "    seconds = seconds - time.hours * 3600\n",
    "    time.minutes = seconds/60\n",
    "    seconds = seconds - time.minutes * 60\n",
    "    time.seconds = seconds\n",
    "    return time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have to think a bit to convince yourself that this technique to convert from one base to another is correct. Assuming you are convinced, you can use these functions to rewrite `add_time`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_time(t1, t2):\n",
    "    seconds = convert_to_seconds(t1) + convert_to_seconds(t2)\n",
    "    return make_time(seconds)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This version is much shorter than the original, and it is much easier to demonstrate that it is correct (assuming, as usual, that the functions it calls are correct).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generalization \n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways, converting from base 60 to base 10 and back is harder than just dealing with times. Base conversion is more abstract; our intuition for dealing with times is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we have the insight to treat times as base 60 numbers and make the investment of writing the conversion functions (`convert_to_seconds` and `make_time`), we get a program that is shorter, easier to read and debug, and more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also easier to add features later. For example, imagine subtracting two `Time`s to find the duration between them. The naive approach would be to implement subtraction with borrowing. Using the conversion functions would be easier and more likely to be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ironically, sometimes making a problem harder (or more general) makes it easier (because there are fewer special cases and fewer opportunities for error).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms \n",
    "\n",
    "When you write a general solution for a class of problems, as opposed to a specific solution to a single problem, you have written an **algorithm**. We mentioned this word before but did not define it carefully. It is not easy to define, so we will try a couple of approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, consider something that is not an algorithm. When you learned to multiply single-digit numbers, you probably memorized the multiplication table. In effect, you memorized 100 specific solutions. That kind of knowledge is not algorithmic.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you were lazy, you probably cheated by learning a few tricks. For example, to find the product of n and 9, you can write `n-1` as the first digit and `10-n` as the second digit. This trick is a general solution for multiplying any single-digit number by 9. That’s an algorithm!\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying, subtraction with borrowing, and long division are all algorithms. One of the characteristics of algorithms is that they do not require any intelligence to carry out. They are mechanical processes in which each step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our opinion, it is embarrassing that humans spend so much time in school learning to execute algorithms that, quite literally, require no intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the process of designing algorithms is interesting, intellectually challenging, and a central part of what we call programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty or conscious thought, are the hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural language is a good example. We all do it, but so far no one has been able to explain _how_ we do it, at least not in the form of an algorithm.\n",
