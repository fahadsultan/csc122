    "It takes only a bit of cleverness to come up with the iterative Fibonacci algorithm. In contrast, consider the following problem: How many different ways can we make change of $\\$1.00$ ($100$ cents), given half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies ($50$ cents, $25$ cents, $10$ cents, $5$ cents, and $1$ cent, respectively)? More generally, can we write a function to compute the number of ways to change any given amount of money?\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem has a simple solution as a recursive function. Suppose we think of the types of coins available as arranged in some order. Then the following relation holds:\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of ways to change amount $a$ using $n$ kinds of coins equals\n",
    "\n",
    "* the number of ways to change amount $a$ using all but the first kind of coin, plus\n",
    "* the number of ways to change amount $a – d$ using all n kinds of coins, where $d$ is the denomination of the first kind of coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why this is true, observe that the ways to make change can be divided into two groups: those that do not use any of the first kind of coin, and those that do. Therefore, the total number of ways to make change for some amount is equal to the number of ways to make change for the amount without using any of the first kind of coin, plus the number of ways to make change assuming that we do use the first kind of coin. But the latter number is equal to the number of ways to make change for the amount that remains after using a coin of the first kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can recursively reduce the problem of changing a given amount to problems of changing smaller amounts or using fewer kinds of coins. Consider this reduction rule carefully, and convince yourself that we can use it to describe an algorithm if we specify the following degenerate cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $a$ is exactly 0, we should count that as 1 way to make change.\n",
    "* If $a$ is less than 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change. \n",
    "* If $n$ is 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.\n",

    "In contrasting iteration and recursion, we must be careful not to confuse the notion of a recursive _process_ with the notion of a recursive _function_. When we describe a function as recursive, we are referring to the syntactic fact that the function declaration refers (either directly or indirectly) to the function itself. But when we describe a process as following a pattern that is, say, linearly recursive, we are speaking about how the process evolves, not about the syntax of how a function is written. It may seem disturbing that we refer to a recursive function such as `fact_iter` as generating an iterative process. However, the process really is iterative: Its state is captured completely by its three state variables, and an interpreter need keep track of only three names in order to execute the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that the distinction between process and function may be confusing is that most implementations of common languages are designed in such a way that the interpretation of any recursive function consumes an amount of memory that grows with the number of function calls, even when the process described is, in principle, iterative. As a consequence, these languages can describe iterative processes only by resorting to special-purpose “looping constructs” such as do, repeat, until, for, and while. The implementation of JavaScript we shall consider in chapter 5 does not share this defect. It will execute an iterative process in constant space, even if the iterative process is described by a recursive function. An implementation with this property is called tail-recursive. With a tail- recursive implementation, iteration can be expressed using the ordinary function call mechanism, so that special iteration constructs are useful only as syntactic sugar.\n"

    "Compare the two processes. From one point of view, they seem hardly different at all. Both compute the same mathematical function on the same domain, and each requires a number of steps proportional to n to compute n!. Indeed, both processes even carry out the same sequence of multiplications, obtaining the same sequence of partial products. On the other hand, when we consider the “shapes” of the two processes, we find that they evolve quite differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the first process. The substitution model reveals a shape of expansion followed by contraction, indicated by the arrow in figure 1.3. The expansion occurs as the process builds up a chain of _deferred operations_ (in this case, a chain of multiplications). The contraction occurs as the operations are actually performed. This type of process, characterized by a chain of deferred operations, is called a _recursive process_. Carrying out this process requires that the interpreter keep track of the operations to be performed later on. In the computation of $n!$, the length of the chain of deferred multiplications, and hence the amount of information needed to keep track of it, grows linearly with n (is proportional to n), just like the number of steps. Such a process is called a _linear recursive process_.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, the second process does not grow and shrink. At each step, all we need to keep track of, for any n, are the current values of the names product, counter, and max_count. We call this an _iterative process_. In general, an iterative process is one whose state can be summarized by a fixed number of _state variables_, together with a fixed rule that describes how the state variables should be updated as the process moves from state to state and an (optional) end test that specifies conditions under which the process should terminate. In computing n!, the number of steps required grows linearly with n. Such a process is called a _linear iterative process_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contrast between the two processes can be seen in another way. In the it- erative case, the state variables provide a complete description of the state of the process at any point. If we stopped the computation between steps, all we would need to do to resume the computation is to supply the interpreter with the values of the three state variables. Not so with the recursive process. In this case there is some additional “hidden” information, maintained by the interpreter and not contained in the state variables, which indicates “where the process is” in negotiating the chain of deferred operations. The longer the chain, the more information must be maintained."

If the process takes k steps, then we must have n≥Fib(k)≈φk/√5. Therefore the number of steps k grows as the logarithm (to the base φ ) of n. Hence, the order of growth is Θ(log n).\n"
