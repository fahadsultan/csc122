    "## Pros and Cons of Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a powerful tool, but it's not always the best tool for the job. Here are some pros and cons of using recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Readable and Elegant**: Recursive solutions are often more readable and elegant than their iterative counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Mathematical**: Many mathematical ideas are naturally recursive, so recursion can be a more organic way to express these ideas in code. For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively i.e. $F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)$. Similarly, the factorial of a number is defined recursively i.e. $n! = n \\times (n-1)!$.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Divide and Conquer and Tree Structures**: Recursive solutions are often well-suited for problems involving trees and graphs, which are ubiqutous in nature, sciences and particularly in computational problems. Since divide and conquer strategies yield a tree like structure, recursion is a natural fit for such problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Performance**: Recursive solutions are often less efficient than iterative solutions due to the overhead of function calls and the potential for repeated work.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Debugging**: Recursive solutions are often harder to debug than iterative solutions. This is because the state of the program is spread across many function calls, making it harder to reason about the program's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Memory**: Recursive solutions often require more memory than iterative solutions. This is because each function call requires memory to store the function's state, and the depth of recursion can be quite large.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Convoluted**: Recursive solutions can be harder to understand than iterative solutions, especially for people who are new to programming.\n",
