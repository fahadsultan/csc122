    "# Extending Operators \n",
    "\n",
    "Some languages make it possible to change the definition of the built- in operators when they are applied to user-defined types. This feature is called **operator overloading**. It is especially useful when defining new mathematical types.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to override the addition operator +, we provide a method named `__add__`:\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, the first parameter is the object on which the method is invoked. The second parameter is conveniently named other to distinguish it from self. To add two Points, we create and return a new Point that contains the sum of the x coordinates and the sum of the y coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we apply the + operator to Point objects, Python invokes `__add__`:\n",
    "p1 = Point(3, 4)\n",
    "p2 = Point(5, 7)\n",
    "p3 = p1 + p2\n",
    "print(p3)\n",
    "The expression p1 + p2 is equivalent to p1.__add__(p2), but obviously more elegant. As an exercise, add a method __sub__(self, other) that overloads the subtraction operator, and try it out. There are several ways to override the behavior of the multiplication operator: by defining a method named __mul__, or __rmul__, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the left operand of * is a Point, Python invokes __mul__, which assumes that the other operand is also a Point. It computes the dot product of the two points, defined according to the rules of linear algebra:\n",
    "def __mul__(self, other):\n",
    "    return self.x * other.x + self.y * other.y\n",
    "If the left operand of * is a primitive type and the right operand is a Point, Python invokes __rmul__, which performs **scalar multiplication**:\n",
    "def __rmul__(self, other):\n",
    "    return Point(other * self.x,  other * self.y)\n",
    "The result is a new Point whose coordinates are a multiple of the original coordinates. If other is a type that cannot be multiplied by a floating-point number, then __rmul__ will yield an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates both kinds of multiplication:\n",
    "p1 = Point(3, 4)\n",
    "p2 = Point(5, 7)\n",
    "print(p1 * p2), print(2 * p2)\n",
    "What happens if we try to evaluate p2 * 2? Since the first parameter is a Point, Python invokes __mul__ with 2 as the second argument. Inside __mul__, the program tries to access the x coordinate of other, which fails because an integer has no attributes:\n",
    "print(p2 * 2)\n",
    "Unfortunately, the error message is a bit opaque. This example demonstrates some of the difficulties of object-oriented programming. Sometimes it is hard enough just to figure out what code is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more complete example of operator overloading, see Appendix (reference overloading).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Special Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a set of special methods that are automatically called when certain operations are performed on objects. These methods are called **magic methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `__init__` method is called automatically when a new instance of a class is created. The `__init__` method is called the **constructor** of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operator Overloading Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table lists the operator overloading methods in Python. These methods are called when an operator is used on an object.\n",
