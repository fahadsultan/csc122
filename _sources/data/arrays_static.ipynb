    "In Figure above, we characterize a list of strings that are the names of the patients in a hospital. It is more likely that a medical information system would manage more comprehensive information on each patient, perhaps represented as an in- stance of a Patient class. From the perspective of the list implementation, the same principle applies: The list will simply keep a sequence of references to those ob- jects. Note as well that a reference to the `None` object can be used as an element of the list to represent an empty bed in the hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that lists and tuples are referential structures is significant to the se- mantics of these classes. A single list instance may include multiple references to the same object as elements of the list, and it is possible for a single object to be an element of two or more lists, as those lists simply store references back to that object. As an example, when you compute a slice of a list, the result is a new list instance, but that new list has references to the same elements that are in the original list, as portrayed in Figure below.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the elements of the list are immutable objects, as with the integer in- stances in Figure 5.5, the fact that the two lists share elements is not that significant, as neither of the lists can cause a change to the shared object. If, for example, the command `temp[2] = 15` were executed from this configuration, that does not change the existing integer object; it changes the reference in cell 2 of the temp list to reference a different object. The resulting configuration is shown in Figure below.\n",

    "The same semantics is demonstrated when making a new list as a copy of an existing one, with a syntax such as backup = list(primes). This produces a new list that is a **shallow copy**, in that it references the same elements as in the first list. With immutable elements, this point is moot. If the contents of the list were of a mutable type, a **deep copy**, meaning a new list with new elements, can be produced by using the deepcopy function from the copy module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a more striking example, it is a common practice in Python to initialize an array of integers using a syntax such as counters = [0]   8. This syntax produces a list of length eight, with all eight elements being the value zero. Technically, all eight cells of the list reference the same object, as shown below.\n",

    "\n",
    "At first glance, the extreme level of aliasing in this configuration may seem alarming. However, we rely on the fact that the referenced integer is immutable. Even a command such as `counters[2] += 1` does not technically change the value of the existing integer instance. This computes a new integer, with value 0 + 1, and sets cell 2 to reference the newly computed value. The resulting configuration is shown in Figure 5.8\n",

    "### Compact Arrays in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings in Python are represented using an array of characters and NOT an array of references. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will refer to such direct representations as a **compact array** because the array is storing the bits that represent the primary data (characters, in the case of strings).\n",

    "A compact array representation of a string.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Compact arrays have several advantages over referential structures in terms of computing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most significantly, the overall memory usage will be much lower for a compact structure because there is no overhead devoted to the explicit storage of the sequence of memory references (in addition to the primary data). \n",
    "\n",
    "That is, a referential structure will typically use 64-bits for the memory address stored in the array, on top of whatever number of bits are used to represent the object that is considered the element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, each Unicode character stored in a compact array within a string typically requires 2 bytes. If each character were stored independently as a one-character string, there would be significantly more bytes used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As another case study, suppose we wish to store a sequence of one million, 64-bit integers. In theory, we might hope to use only 64 million bits. However, we estimate that a Python list will use four to five times as much memory. Each element of the list will result in a 64-bit memory address being stored in the primary array, and an `int` instance being stored elsewhere in memory. Python allows you to query the actual number of bytes being used for the primary storage of any object. This is done using the `getsizeof` function of the `sys` module. \n",
    "\n",
    "On our system, the size of a typical `int` object requires 14 bytes of memory (well beyond the 4 bytes needed for representing the actual 64-bit number). In all, the list will be using 18 bytes per entry, rather than the 4 bytes that a compact list of integers would require.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important advantage to a compact structure for high-performance computing is that the primary data are stored consecutively in memory. Note well that this is not the case for a referential structure. That is, even though a list maintains careful ordering of the sequence of memory addresses, where those elements reside in memory is not determined by the list. Because of the workings of the cache and memory hierarchies of computers, it is often advantageous to have data stored in memory near other data that might be used in the same computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the apparent inefficiencies of referential structures, we will generally be content with the convenience of Pythonâ€™s lists and tuples in this book. The only place in which we consider alternatives will be in Chapter 15, which focuses on the impact of memory usage on data structures and algorithms. Python provides several means for creating compact arrays of various types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary support for compact arrays is in a module named `array`. That module defines a class, also named `array`, providing compact storage for arrays of primitive data types. A portrayal of such an array of integers is shown in Figure 5.10.\n",

As a tangible example, the type code, `'i'` , designates an array of (signed) integers, typically represented using at least 16-bits each. \n",
