    "When creating a low-level array in a computer system, the precise size of that array must be explicitly declared in order for the system to properly allocate a consecutive piece of memory for its storage. For example, Figure 5.11 displays an array of 12 bytes that might be stored in memory locations 2146 through 2157.\n",

    "Because the system might dedicate neighboring memory locations to store other data, the capacity of an array cannot trivially be increased by expanding into sub- sequent cells. In the context of representing a Python tuple or str instance, this constraint is no problem. Instances of those classes are immutable, so the correct size for an underlying array can be fixed when the object is instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s list class presents a more interesting abstraction. Although a list has a particular length when constructed, the class allows us to add elements to the list, with no apparent limit on the overall capacity of the list. To provide this abstraction, Python relies on an algorithmic sleight of hand known as a **dynamic array**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first key to providing the semantics of a dynamic array is that a list instance maintains an underlying array that often has greater capacity than the current length of the list. For example, while a user may have created a list with five elements, the system may have reserved an underlying array capable of storing eight object references (rather than only five). This extra capacity makes it easy to append a new element to the list by using the next available cell of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a user continues to append elements to a list, any reserved capacity will eventually be exhausted. In that case, the class requests a new, larger array from the system, and initializes the new array so that its prefix matches that of the existing smaller array. At that point in time, the old array is no longer needed, so it is reclaimed by the system. Intuitively, this strategy is much like that of the hermit crab, which moves into a larger shell when it outgrows its previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We give empirical evidence that Python’s list class is based upon such a strategy. The source code for our experiment is displayed in Code Fragment 5.1, and a sample output of that program is given in Code Fragment 5.2. We rely on a function named `getsizeof` that is available from the `sys` module. This function reports the number of bytes that are being used to store an object in Python. For a list, it reports the number of bytes devoted to the array and other instance variables of the list, but not any space devoted to elements referenced by the list.\n"

    "In evaluating the results of the experiment, we draw attention to the first line of output from Code Fragment 5.2. We see that an empty list instance already requires a certain number of bytes of memory (72 on our system). In fact, each object in Python maintains some state, for example, a reference to denote the class to which it belongs. Although we cannot directly access private instance variables for a list, we can speculate that in some form it maintains state information akin to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `_n`: The number of actual elements currently stored in the list.\n",
    "* `_capacity`: The maximum number of elements that could be stored in the currently allocated array.\n",
    "* `_A`: The reference to the currently allocated array (initially `None`)\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as the first element is inserted into the list, we detect a change in the underlying size of the structure. In particular, we see the number of bytes jump from 72 to 104, an increase of exactly 32 bytes. Our experiment was run on a 64-bit machine architecture, meaning that each memory address is a 64-bit number (i.e., 8 bytes). We speculate that the increase of 32 bytes reflects the allocation of an underlying array capable of storing four object references. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that we do not see any underlying change in the memory usage after inserting the second, third, or fourth element into the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the fifth element has been added to the list, we see the memory usage jump from 104 bytes to 136 bytes. If we assume the original base usage of 72 bytes for the list, the total of 136 suggests an additional 64 = 8 × 8 bytes that provide capacity for up to eight object references. Again, this is consistent with the experiment, as the memory usage does not increase again until the ninth insertion. At that point, the 200 bytes can be viewed as the original 72 plus an additional 128-byte array to store 16 object references. The 17th insertion pushes the overall memory usage to 272 = 72 + 200 = 72 + 25 × 8, hence enough to store up to 25 element references\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a list is a referential structure, the result of getsizeof for a list instance only includes the size for representing its primary structure; it does not account for memory used by the objects that are elements of the list. In our experiment, we repeatedly append None to the list, because we do not care about the contents, but we could append any type of object without affecting the number of bytes reported by getsizeof(data).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to continue such an experiment for further iterations, we might try to discern the pattern for how large of an array Python creates each time the ca- pacity of the previous array is exhausted (see Exercises R-5.2 and C-5.13). Before exploring the precise sequence of capacities used by Python, we continue in this section by describing a general approach for implementing dynamic arrays and for performing an asymptotic analysis of their performance."

Support for creating low-level arrays is provided by a module named `ctypes`. Because we will not typically use such a low-level structure in the remain- der of this book, we omit a detailed explanation of the `ctypes` module. Instead, we wrap the necessary command for declaring the raw array within a private utility method `_make_array`. The hallmark expansion procedure is performed in our nonpublic `_resize` method."

    "The strategy of replacing an array with a new, larger array might at first seem slow, because a single append operation may require `Ω(n)` time to perform, where `n` is the current number of elements in the array. However, notice that by doubling the capacity during an array replacement, our new array allows us to add `n` new elements before the array must be replaced again. In this way, there are many simple `append` operations for each expensive one (see Figure 5.13). This fact allows us to show that performing a series of operations on an initially empty dynamic array is efficient in terms of its total running time.\n",

When choosing the geometric base, there exists a trade- off between run-time efficiency and memory usage. With a base of 2 (i.e., doubling the array), if the last insertion causes a resize event, the array essentially ends up twice as large as it needs to be. If we instead increase the array by only 25% of its current size (i.e., a geometric base of 1.25), we do not risk wasting as much memory in the end, but there will be more intermediate resize events along the way. Still it is possible to prove an O(1) amortized bound, using a constant factor greater than the 3 cyber-dollars per operation used in the proof of Proposition 5.1 (see Exercise C-5.15). The key to the performance is that the amount of additional space is proportional to the current size of the array.\n",
