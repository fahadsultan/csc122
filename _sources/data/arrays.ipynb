    "Another important advantage to a compact structure for high-performance computing is that the primary data are stored consecutively in memory. Note well that this is not the case for a referential structure. That is, even though a list maintains careful ordering of the sequence of memory addresses, where those elements reside in memory is not determined by the list. Because of the workings of the cache and memory hierarchies of computers, it is often advantageous to have data stored in memory near other data that might be used in the same computations.\n",

    "Python’s list class presents a more interesting abstraction. Although a list has a particular length when constructed, the class allows us to add elements to the list, with no apparent limit on the overall capacity of the list. To provide this abstraction, Python relies on an algorithmic sleight of hand known as a **Dynamic Array**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first key to providing the semantics of a dynamic array is that a list instance maintains <u>an underlying array that often has greater capacity than the current length of the list</u>. For example, while a user may have created a list with five elements, the system may have reserved an underlying array capable of storing eight object references (rather than only five). This <u>extra capacity makes it easy to append a new element to the list</u> by using the next available cell of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>If a user continues to append elements to a list, any **reserved capacity will eventually be exhausted**. In that case, **the class requests a new, larger array from the system**, and initializes the new array so that its prefix matches that of the existing smaller array.</u> At that point in time, the old array is no longer needed, so it is reclaimed by the system. Intuitively, this strategy is much like that of the hermit crab, which moves into a larger shell when it outgrows its previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We give empirical evidence that Python’s list class is based upon such a strategy. We rely on a function named `getsizeof` that is available from the `sys` module. This function reports the number of bytes that are being used to store an object in Python. For a list, it reports the number of bytes devoted to the array and other instance variables of the list, but not any space devoted to elements referenced by the list.\n"

    "In evaluating the results of the experiment, we draw attention to the first line of output from Code Fragment 5.2. We see that an empty list instance already requires a certain number of bytes of memory (72 on our system). In fact, each object in Python maintains some state, for example, a reference to denote the class to which it belongs. Although we cannot directly access private instance variables for a list, we can speculate that in some form it maintains state information akin to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `_n`: The number of actual elements currently stored in the list.\n",
    "* `_capacity`: The maximum number of elements that could be stored in the currently allocated array.\n",
    "* `_A`: The reference to the currently allocated array (initially `None`)\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as the first element is inserted into the list, we detect a change in the underlying size of the structure. In particular, we see the number of bytes jump from 72 to 104, an increase of exactly 32 bytes. Our experiment was run on a 64-bit machine architecture, meaning that each memory address is a 64-bit number (i.e., 8 bytes). We speculate that the increase of 32 bytes reflects the allocation of an underlying array capable of storing four object references. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that we do not see any underlying change in the memory usage after inserting the second, third, or fourth element into the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the fifth element has been added to the list, we see the memory usage jump from 104 bytes to 136 bytes. If we assume the original base usage of 72 bytes for the list, the total of 136 suggests an additional 64 = 8 × 8 bytes that provide capacity for up to eight object references. Again, this is consistent with the experiment, as the memory usage does not increase again until the ninth insertion. At that point, the 200 bytes can be viewed as the original 72 plus an additional 128-byte array to store 16 object references. The 17th insertion pushes the overall memory usage to 272 = 72 + 200 = 72 + 25 × 8, hence enough to store up to 25 element references\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a list is a referential structure, the result of getsizeof for a list instance only includes the size for representing its primary structure; it does not account for memory used by the objects that are elements of the list. In our experiment, we repeatedly append None to the list, because we do not care about the contents, but we could append any type of object without affecting the number of bytes reported by getsizeof(data).\n",

When choosing the geometric base, there exists a trade- off between run-time efficiency and memory usage. With a base of 2 (i.e., doubling the array), if the last insertion causes a resize event, the array essentially ends up twice as large as it needs to be. If we instead increase the array by only 25% of its current size (i.e., a geometric base of 1.25), we do not risk wasting as much memory in the end, but there will be more intermediate resize events along the way. Still it is possible to prove an O(1) amortized bound, using a constant factor greater than the 3 cyber-dollars per operation used in the proof of Proposition 5.1 (see Exercise C-5.15).
