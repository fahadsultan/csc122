    "In this chapter, we explore Python’s various “sequence” classes, namely the built- in `list`, `tuple`, and `str` classes. There is significant commonality between these classes, most notably: each supports indexing to access an individual element of a sequence, using a syntax such as `seq[k]`, and each uses a low-level concept known as an **array** to represent the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are significant differences in the abstractions that these classes represent, and in the way that instances of these classes are represented internally by Python. Because these classes are used so widely in Python programs, and because they will become building blocks upon which we will develop more complex data structures, it is imperative that we establish a clear understanding of both the public behavior and inner workings of these classes.\n",
