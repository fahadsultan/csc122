    "## What is Test Driven Development?\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. First the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. Kent Beck, who is credited with having developed or 'rediscovered' the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test-driven development is related to the test-first programming concepts of extreme programming, begun in 1999, but more recently has created more general interest in its own right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers also apply the concept to improving and debugging legacy code developed with older techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The TDD Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps are generally followed in TDD:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a test\n",
    "2. Run all tests and see if the new test fails\n",
    "3. Write the code\n",
    "4. Run tests\n",
    "5. Refactor code\n",
    "6. Repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why TDD?\n",
    "\n",
    "* TDD reduces the time required for validation and testing\n",
    "* TDD reduces the time required for debugging\n",
    "* TDD improves the design and architecture of the code\n",
    "* TDD reduces the time required for code maintenance\n",
    "* TDD can be used as a documentation of the system\n",
    "* TDD increases the confidence of the developer\n",
    "* TDD increases the confidence of the customer\n",
    "* TDD reduces the time required for regression testing\n",
    "* TDD reduces the time required for integration\n",
    "* TDD reduces the time required for code integration\n",

    "### Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. Intuitively, one can view a unit as the smallest testable part of an application. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure. In object-oriented programming, a unit is often an entire interface, such as a class, but could be an individual method. Unit tests are short code fragments created by programmers or occasionally by white box testers during the development process. It forms the basis for component testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, each test case is independent from the others. Substitutes such as method stubs, mock objects, fakes, and test harnesses can be used to assist testing a module in isolation. Unit tests are typically written and run by software developers to ensure that code meets its design and behaves as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Doctests\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctest is a module in the Python standard library that allows the easy generation of tests based on output from the standard Python interpreter shell, cut and pasted into docstrings. This allows the tester to make sure that the code is doing what it is supposed to do, and that the interface is correct. Doctest is a great tool for testing small examples that are used in documentation, and can serve as a kind of regression test. It is less useful for more complicated cases, and is not intended for use with a test suite, but rather for examples that are small enough to be checked by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyTest\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTest is a testing framework that allows users to write test programs using Python. The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTest is a mature full-featured Python testing tool that helps you write better programs. It is a third party alternative to unittest included in the Python standard library. PyTest provides a core set of tools for building test automation, and supports testing with Python’s standard unittest library, and pytest can be extended with a rich set of plugins.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple example of unit testing in Python. We'll create a simple function that adds two numbers together and returns the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll create a file called `calc.py` and add the following code:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Add Function\"\"\"\n",

    "def subtract(x, y):\n",

    "    return x / y\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
