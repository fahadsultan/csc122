    "Brute Force Algorithms are exactly what they sound like – straightforward methods that relying on sheer computing power to **try every possibility** rather than using insight to efficiently narrow down the possibilities. Brute force algorithms are also known as “exhaustive search” algorithms, because they try all possible answers until they find the right one. \n",

    "For example, imagine you have a small padlock with 4 digits, each from 0-9. You forgot your combination, but you don't want to buy another padlock. Since you can't remember any of the digits, you have to use a brute force method to open the lock. So you set all the numbers back to 0 and try them one by one: 0001, 0002, 0003, and so on until it opens. In the worst case scenario, it will take you 10,000 tries to open the lock.\n"
